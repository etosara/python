Strong suggestion here, use a variable name which makes sense for the data you're working with.  One of the strengths of Python over other languages is its readability, so don't ruin that by using shitty variable names.  Using good variable names will help you keep track of what you're doing, reduce the number of comments you need to leave, and save you time."

Strings, which can be sliced into pieces (individual characters), can be broken into distinct pieces for iteration.  Lists, which have very clear segments, can be iterated over.  On the other hand, numbers, which don't have pieces, can't be iterated over, they're not iterable objects.  But!  That's where things like range( ) come from.  range( ) creates the list of numbers that you might want operate over in succession."

    "We've hit on some aspects of dictionaries, but I've not *really* expressed the up and downsides of dictionaries.  Up side is they're fast.  Downside is they don't necessarily keep things in order.  Downside first.  When you put things into a dictionary, it doesn't necessarily keep track of the order you put them in, unlike with a list where the things you put in are kept in the order they are put in.  If you need the keys in your dictionary to be in a particular order, you need to use something called an Ordered Dictionary.  In the newest version of Python, regular dictionaries will try to maintain the original order, but it's not something you can rely on.  Anyway, a potential downside of dictionaries.  But!  The upside!"
